Hi, I'm Nihal Nayak. I work as a NLP Engineer at [Stride.AI](stride.ai).

My research interests are:

- Language Acquisition: I like to understand how people acquire new vocabulary in a language. [\[1\]](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-0524) [\[2\]](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-3005)

- Natural Language Processing: I build probablistic models to extract useful insights from unstructured data.


I have previously worked with Prof. H S Jamadgani at Indian Institute of Science ([IISc](http://www.iisc.ac.in/)) as an Intern and then briefly as a Project Assistant.

<!-- I'm a Project Intern at DESE (Formerly CEDT), [IISc](http://www.iisc.ac.in/) under Prof. H S Jamadagni. I also worked as a summer intern at [Stride.AI](stride.ai). Currently, trying to solve problems in Education, using Natural Language Processing.
