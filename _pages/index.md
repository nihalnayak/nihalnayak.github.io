Hi, I'm Nihal Nayak.

I work as a NLP Engineer at [Stride.AI](stride.ai). I have previously worked with Prof. H S Jamadgani at Indian Institute of Science ([IISc](http://www.iisc.ac.in/)) as an Intern and then briefly as a Project Assistant.

My research interests are:

- Natural Language Processing: Probablistic models to extract useful entities from unstructured data [\[1\]](/assets/papers/2019/dexter_aaai_make.pdf)

- Human Language Learning: Computational techniques to model how people acquire new vocabulary [\[2\]](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-0524) [\[3\]](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-3005)
<!--
My long-term research goal is to develop learning techniques for language-related tasks in Information Extraction, Reasoning and Language Learning. -->

<!-- I'm a Project Intern at DESE (Formerly CEDT), [IISc](http://www.iisc.ac.in/) under Prof. H S Jamadagni. I also worked as a summer intern at [Stride.AI](stride.ai). Currently, trying to solve problems in Education, using Natural Language Processing.
